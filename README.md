Hello!

My name is Tracy Nguyen. I am an aspiring programmer; most of my coding experience is in Java and C#. In my free time when I am not working on school projects or practicing code, I enjoy playing video games. Currently, my favorite games are Dota 2, Mass Effect, Assassin's Creed, and Mirror's Edge.
